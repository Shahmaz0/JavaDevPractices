# JavaDevPractices

This repository comprises two distinct Java projects demonstrating JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) fundamentals. `JavaApplication1` is a GUI-based application designed to interact with a database, potentially for displaying images and performing other data manipulations. It leverages `ConnectionProvider.java` for streamlined database connections and `PreparedStatement.java` for secure operations.

The `jdbcPractices.java` project, on the other hand, provides a command-line collection of essential JDBC examples. This includes modules for inserting, selecting, and updating data, each encapsulated in a dedicated class for clarity and modularity. Both projects require a Java Development Kit (JDK 8+) and a compatible JDBC driver, which needs to be configured with your database credentials and added to the respective project's classpath for successful compilation and execution.
